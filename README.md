GWL Predictor
Overview
The GWL Predictor project is a machine learning model designed to predict the Gross Weight Load (GWL) based on historical data. The model leverages data science techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms to make accurate predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and data normalization to ensure the model’s accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Includes multiple models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for GWL prediction.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score, and others to evaluate model performance.
Model Comparison: Compares performance of different models and selects the best one for deployment.

Requirements:
Python 3.7+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost (if applicable)
Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis)
ou can install all dependencies by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gwl-predictor.git
cd gwl-predictor
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Data Loading
Load your dataset into the system:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/dataset.csv')


3. Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline handles missing values, data normalization, and feature selection:
from preprocessing import preprocess_data
processed_data = preprocess_data(data)

4. Model Training
Train a machine learning model using the following code:

from models import train_model
model = train_model(processed_data)

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model:

from models import evaluate_model
evaluate_model(model, processed_data)

5. Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions:

predictions = model.predict(new_data)
Results
The project includes performance metrics and visualizations to compare the accuracy of different models. These results can be found in the results directory.
